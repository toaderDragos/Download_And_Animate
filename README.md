# Download_And_Animate
This project was made for the Android Kotlin Developer Nanodegree by Udacity and Google.
It showcases the use of a personalized loading button with animation, using valueAnimator, canvas operations.
It uses a Broadcast Receiver, Download Manager and Notification Manager to notify the user when the chosen download has ended.
When the Notification is clicked there is a new Activity that showcases details and if the download was successful or not.
